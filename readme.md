# Discord Token Server Checker

This Node.js project checks whether the Discord tokens listed in `tokens.txt` are members of a specific server (e.g., `GIF GALAXY`). It logs the tokens into `special.txt` if they are in the server, or `goods.txt` if they are not.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Supports multiple Discord tokens
- Server name is entered via CMD at runtime
- `special.txt`: Tokens that are in the specified server
- `goods.txt`: Tokens that are **not** in the specified server
- Handles login errors gracefully
